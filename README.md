# Browser Engineering Book Swift

My attempt at following the [browser engineering book](https://browser.engineering/) while simultaneously learning Swift.

## Dependencies

- [SwiftSDL2](https://github.com/ctreffs/SwiftSDL2)
- [SkiaKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SkiaKit)
- [BlueSocket](https://github.com/Kitura/BlueSocket)
- [BlueSSLService](https://github.com/Kitura/BlueSSLService)

SkiaKit needs a modified version with a few more APIs implemented.
